% ToDo: create the function triangulate.m that performs a triangulation
%       with the homogeneous algebraic method (DLT)
%
%       The entries are (x1, x2, P1, P2, imsize), where:
%           - x1, and x2 are the Euclidean coordinates of two matching 
%             points in two different images.
%           - P1 and P2 are the two camera matrices
%           - imsize is a two-dimensional vector with the image size

%% 3. Depth map computation with local methods (SSD)

% Data images: 'scene1.row3.col3.ppm','scene1.row3.col4.ppm'
% Disparity ground truth: 'truedisp.row3.col3.pgm'

% Write a function called 'stereo_computation' that computes the disparity
% between a pair of rectified images using a local method based on a matching cost 
% between two local windows.
% 
% The input parameters are 5:
% - left image
% - right image
% - minimum disparity
% - maximum disparity
% - window size (e.g. a value of 3 indicates a 3x3 window)
% - matching cost (the user may able to choose between SSD and NCC costs)
%
% In this part we ask to implement only the SSD cost
%
% Evaluate the results changing the window size (e.g. 3x3, 9x9, 20x20,
% 30x30) and the matching cost. Comment the results.
%
% Note 1: Use grayscale images
% Note 2: Use 0 as minimum disparity and 16 as the the maximum one.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% 4. OPTIONAL: Depth map computation with local methods (NCC)

% Complete the previous function by adding the implementation of the NCC
% cost.
%
% Evaluate the results changing the window size (e.g. 3x3, 9x9, 20x20,
% 30x30) and the matching cost. Comment the results.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% 5. Depth map computation with local methods

% Data images: '0001_rectified_s.png','0002_rectified_s.png'

% Test the functions implemented in the previous section with the facade
% images. Try different matching costs and window sizes and comment the
% results.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% 6. OPTIONAL: Bilateral weights

% Modify the 'stereo_computation' so that you use bilateral weights (or
% adaptive support weights) in the matching cost of two windows.
% Reference paper: Yoon and Kweon, "Adaptive Support-Weight Approach for Correspondence Search", IEEE PAMI 2006
%
% Comment the results and compare them to the previous results (no weights).
%
% Note: Use grayscale images (the paper uses color images)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% 7. OPTIONAL:  Stereo computation with Belief Propagation

% Use the UGM library used in module 2 and implement a  
% stereo computation method that minimizes a simple stereo energy with 
% belief propagation. 
% For example, use an L2 pixel-based data term and 
% the same regularization term you used in module 2. 
% Or pick a stereo paper (based on belief propagation) from the literature 
% and implement it. Pick a simple method or just simplify the method they propose.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% 8. OPTIONAL:  Depth computation with Plane Sweeping

% Implement the plane sweeping method explained in class.
